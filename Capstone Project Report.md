Abstract
----------
This paper examines the effectiveness of Joseph D. Piotroski’s F-Score as an accounting-based fundamental analysis investment tool. Originally conceived for the implementation on high book-to-market companies, F-Score has proven to be consistent in identifying and differentiating companies with high returns from low returns when applied across a wide range of public listed firms. F-Score's performance is also influenced by external factors such as global economic performance, especially when identifying companies with high F-scores. Besides, F-Score’s effectiveness is undermined by the simplicity of its financial indicators when analyzing companies from different sectors, which adopts unique financial reporting format and standards. Based on the findings, investors can utilize F-Score to make informed adequate decisions while its limitations into consideration. 

Introduction
------------
This study seeks to examine the usefulness of Joseph D. Piotroski’s F-Score which uses historical financial statement information to identify companies with superior performance as well as deploy it as a foundational base where other inputs can be modified to further improve on the original’s effectiveness.

Literature Review
-----------------

### Introduction to F-Score

The F-score is a widely known performance/investment strategy due to its simplicity and accessibility. It uses public published information readily available for investor to separate strong performers from weak performers among high book-to-market firms. A score is computed based on 9 criteria categorized into 3 different groups and are summarized as follows:



|	|Profitability|
|-----|----|
|1|Return on Assets	1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise|
|2|	Operating Cash Flow	1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise|
|3|	Change in Return of Assets (ROA)	1 point if ROA is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)|
|4|Accruals	1 point if Operating Cash Flow/Total Assets is higher than ROA in the current year, 0 otherwise|

| |Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds|
|---|---|
|5|	Change in Leverage (long-term) ratio	1 point if the ratio is lower this year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise|
|6|	Change in Current ratio	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise
|7|	Change in the number of shares	1 point if no new shares were issued during the last year

| |Operating Efficiency|
|---|---|
|8|	Change in Gross Margin	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise
|9	|Change in Asset Turnover ratio	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise


The total score is tabulated and companies are split into two main groups, High F-Score and Low F-Score. High F-Score consists of companies with score between 8-9, while low F-Score consists of companies with score between 0-1. Based on the grouping, an investor can make informed investment decisions (etc. holding companies' shares with high F-Score and short companies's shares with low F-Score).

### Relevancy of F-Score in Today’s Economy

The empirical study of the F-Score is based on companies selected from 1976 and 1996. Since then, in the past 20 years, the overall economy landscape has experienced massive seismic shifts; from multiple recessions (Dot.com bubble burst from 1997-2001, The Great Recession from 2007-2012) to the explosive growth of tech-based companies and slow-decline of manufacturing firms. Besides, there have been monumental changes to organization structure of companies, many opting for a more flat-based structure rather than a hierarchical one to take advantage of revolutionary IT developments to tackle the ever-changing economy. This has in-turn impact on how companies’ resources and finances are managed. 

While the aforementioned events may undermine the credibility of the F-Score, amongst the many changes, stronger financial regulations and corporate governance have strengthened F-Score’s core idea of utilizing historical financial performance data to predict strong performers. Financial regulatory compliance has been consistently implemented and its framework improved across the decades, aiming for higher financial reporting transparency and accountability.  To name one, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also known the “Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act in response to the financial scandal revolving Enron mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures from  corporations from possibly fraudulent activities. With better financial reporting, financial data provided from companies can be used more reliably for analytic purposes.

In conclusion, while recent economy changes may downplay F-Score’s usefulness, the stringent financial disclosures required from companies serves as an overarching foundation for F-Score due to its heavy reliance on such data. These circumstances give rise to strong motivation and purpose to reassess the credibility of the F-Score and modify the indicators accordingly if needed, to suit the different stance of today’s economy. 

### Extension of F-Score's Applicability to Non-Financially Distressed Companies

F-Score was originally intended to identify profitable returns from high book-to-market companies which are usually associated with financially distress firms. The formation of the F-Score naturally takes into account the specific financial characteristics of such firms. Therefore, F-Score's underlying fundamental theory and rationales should be access to determine its application on non-financially distressed companies. 

**Market Efficiency Hypothesis**

The original F-Score is firmly based on taking advantage of the varying degrees of the Market Efficiency hypothesis, which influence the extent of share prices incorporating financial information.  

The original F-Score states that due to the lack of current financial information of financial distressed companies instigated by low coverage from financial institutions, it has bolstered the informational weight of financial statements and its influence on holding returns. Besides, due to the low coverage, F-Score takes advantage of the slow dissemination of financial information, investing in selected companies before such information is reflected into the share price. 

Conversely, taking into account of the rapid circulation of financial information for public-listed companies, financial statements should not have as a significant impact on its holding returns compared to financially distressed companies. Therefore, the application of F-Score on companies in general may be dampenned.  

**F-Score Indicators**

To assess the applicability of F-Score on all companies, F-Score indicators relevant specifically to high book-to-market companies should be discerned and their basis evaluated. 

After evaluating each indicator, the F-Score Indicator “Change in Number of Shares” stands out as the sole indicator that specifically address high book-to-market companies. As noted from Joseph D. Piotroksi’s F-Score Paper:

>“….Financially distressed firms that raise external capital could be signalling their inability to generate sufficient internal funds to service future obligations. Moreover, the fact that these firms are willing to issue equity when their stock prices are likely to be depressed (i.e., high cost of capital) highlights the poor financial condition facing these firms”

While addressing the specific nature of a high book-to-market company, the "Change in Number of Shares" can simultaneously serve as a signalling indicator for other companies, if the Pecking Order Theory is taken into account.

The Pecking Order Theory states that a company will raise its capital in the following order due to asymmetric information between the company’s manager and outsider investors: Internal funds, long-term debts and issuance of shares. The capital financing from these three sources provides different signalling to investors:- 

•	Using internal funds demonstrates a company’s capability to generate excess cash flow

•	Incurring long-term debts reflects a company’s earnings growth to outstrip the interest rates

•	Issuing share signals to investors that management believe that its shares are overvalued, thus taking advantage of the over-valuation

Thus, the increase in number of shares may also indeed serve as a negative indicator for all companies instead of specifically high book-to-market companies, albeit for differing reasons. Based on the assessment above, F-Score may serve as a valuable analysis tool for all companies.

**F-Score Grouping**

Besides assessing F-Score's indicators, some degree of modification to F-Score's original grouping: Low (0-1) and High (8-9) can be considered to assist its applicability on all companies. A narrower score band presents as a strict criteria in selecting companies. It helps to minimize the high risk of investing on financial distressed company, ensuring the companies selected are truly from both ends of the performance spectrum. However, the downside of a narrower score band includes lesser diversification of risk and lower investment opportunites stemming from a smaller invesment pool of companies. 

Using F-Score on non-financially distressed companies, there is more liberty in the grouping of F-Scores from dealing with lower risks. Wes Gray from Alpha Architect and Nehal Joshipura from InvestmentWaves both opted a higher F-Score grouping range: Low (1-3) and High (7-9).   

Research Motivation
------------------
The aim of this research is to reinforce the notion that F-Score is still relevant as an investment tool today as noted under the literature review.  In addition, F-Score’s effectiveness will also be evaluated under different scenarios. These are being tested under the following hypothesis:- 

**Hypothesis 1:**

Null: The difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return = 0

Alternate:  The difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return is not 0

*Explanation*: The hypothesis serves to evaluate F-Score general usefulness as an investment indicator by testing whether High F-Score companies have superior returns compared to Low F-Score companies.

**Hypothesis 2:**

Null: The High/Low grouping based on F-Score is consistent with the original F-Score grouping

Alternate: The High/Low grouping based on F-Score is not consistent with the original F-Score grouping

*Explanation*: The hypothesis serves to check whether there can be any positive adjustments made to the grouping (High/Low) of the F-Score such as incorporating/excluding certain scores in both groups.

**Hypothesis 3:**

Null: Changing increase in number of shares as a positive indicator yields lesser or no difference in returns (<=Original F-Score)

Alternate: Changing increase in number of shares as a positive indicator yields greater returns (>Original F-Score)

*Explanation*: The hypothesis serves to test the explanatory power of “Change in number of shares” Indicator, simultaneously assessing whether the Pecking Order Theory (refer to Literature Review) holds true.

**Hypothesis 4:**

Null: If Hypothesis 1 is null, the difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return across different industries < 0

Alternate:  If Hypothesis 1 is null, the difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return across different industries  is  >= 0

*Explanation*: The hypothesis serves to assess F-Score’s effectiveness and applicability for each specific sector.

**Hypothesis 5:**

Null: If Hypothesis 1 is null, the difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return across different years is  < 0

Alternate: If Hypothesis 1 is null,  the difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return across different years >= 0

*Explanation*: The hypothesis serves to evaluate whether explanatory power of the F-Score is affected by business cycles or other time factors.



Research Overview
-----------------
The overall research process is summarized in the flowchart as follows:

![](https://github.com/kohtseyoung/F-Score-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Images/Research%20Layout%20(Modified).png)

As seen from the table above, the main three data sources are from NASDAQ, Morningsar and Yahoo Finance. From these three data sources, the raw data files are company list, income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, key ratio share price and industry.  The raw data after processed by R are grouped into the following: F-Score Indicators, Grouping (High/Low) and Holding Return. Lastly, based on the results from the analysis of the processed data, it will provide evidence on whether following the hypotheses raised (Please refer to *Research Analysis* Section) can be confirm or falsify.

To organize the research process and its findings, the report is split into the following sections to further elaborate on each topic area:-

1.	Data Collection
2.	Data Wrangling
3.	Research Analysis

Data Collection
---------------
### Financial Information

The sample population of companies used is based from NASDAQ. There is a list of companies listed on NASDAQ available for download in excel format. The total number in the original list is 3288. For completeness of data, companies with insufficient information (etc. Market Cap = 0, no Sector/Industry information) are filtered out. Besides, we also removed companies that belong to the finance sector due to the uniqueness of its financial reporting standard for consistency purposes. The final sample population numbered to 2053.

For financial information that is required for F-Score testing, Morningstar is used due to the consistency in formatting of the relevant financial information. Besides, the extraction of information is relatively straightforward due to the structured format of its web links. The information extracted per company includes 4 data sets: “Income Statement”, “Balance Sheet”, “Cash Flow Statement” and “Key Ratios”. 

### Share Prices 
The R Package “Quantmod” was used to extract companies’ share prices and holding returns from Yahoo Finance based on their respective symbols/tickers. Similarly to the extraction of information from Morningstar, some companies’ information are not available. These companies are removed from the testing population.



### Data Collection Limitation & Biases

Data Collection is limited by broken links or unavailable data from each data source. 11 companies have been removed from the sample population due to no financial Information (8 companies) and no share price data (3 companies) available respectively from Morningstar and Yahoo Finance.

As the companies tested are those listed on NASDAQ in 2017 for the period 2008-2017, there will be a significant survivorship bias as companies with low performance that are subsequently delisted from the period 2008-2017 would not be part of the testing population. This would inevitably overstate the returns of low F-Score companies.

Lastly, some financial data collected are rounded up to the nearest million. This may pose as an issue for identifying and analyzing activities of companies with smaller market cap. 

Data Wrangling
--------------
### 1. Financial Information
The information from income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement consist of 5 year data, while key ratio consists of 10 years of data. As a business cycle tend to be around 10 years, using 10 years’ worth of financial data would be helpful to show the usefulness of the model across an entire business cycle. It should be noted that 10 years’ worth of data would be computed into a 9 year series as some indicators rely on changes between two years, as such, the 1st year data cannot be computed solely by itself.

**F-Score Indicators**

Before diving head-in into the extraction of the respective indicators, only relevant and required information required for computational purposes are initially pulled from the respective financial data and stored as objects under R. This includes the following:  Net Income, Year End Assets, ROA, Operating Cash Flow, Long-term Debt Ratio, Current Ratio, Number of Shares, Gross Profit Margin and Sales.

**_Indicator 1 – Return on Assets (ROA)_**

ROA under F-Score and the ROA under Morningstar are computed differently. The former uses beginning year-end assets, while the latter using average assets as the denominator for computing ROA. F-Score and Morningstar’s ROA shall be coined as ROA(Beginning Assets) and ROA(Average Assets) respectively. As such, we are to re-compute the 1st 5 years ROA using information from the income statement and balance sheet data. For the last 5 years, the beginning of the year assets is recomputed based on the Morningstar’s ROA extracted from the key ratio statement. The formulas are as follows:

>Beginning Year Assets = Current Year Net Income/ROA(Average Assets) – Year End Assets

>ROA (Beginning Assets) = Current Year Net Income/ Beginning Year Assets

**_Indicator 2 – Operating Cash Flow (CFO)_**

Operating Cash Flow numerator data is obtained from the key ratio statement, which is subsequently divided by Beginning Year Assets as computed under the above section.

**_Indicator 3 – Change in ROA_**

Change in ROA is the difference between current year and past year ROA based on the computed ROA.  

**_Indicator 4 – Accruals_**

The difference between CFO and ROA as previously computed.


**_Indicator 5 – Change in Leverage (Long-Term) Ratio_**

There is a difference between the denominator of the leverage ratio between F-Score and Morningstar, the former being the average assets during the year, the latter being year-end assets.
The respective leverages shall be coined as Leverage (Average) and Leverage (Year-end) respectively.
The latest 5 years long-term debt is extracted from Morningstar’s balance sheet while the earliest 5 years are derived from the Leverage (Year-end) extracted from the key ratio statement. The formulas are as follows:

>Leverage (Average) = Leverage (Year-end)* Year-end Assets /100*Average Assets

>Change in Leverage is subsequently the difference between current year and past year Leverage (Average).

**_Indicator 6 – Change in Current Ratio_**

Current Ratio data is extracted from key ratio statement.  Change in current ratio is the difference between current year and past year current ratio

**_Indicator 7 – Change in Shares_**

Number of Shares data is extracted from key ratio statement.  Change in Shares is the difference between current year and past year Number of Shares.

**_Indicator 8 – Change in Gross Profit Margin_**

Gross profit margin data is extracted from key ratio statement.  Change in gross profit margin is the difference between current year and past year gross profit margin.

**_Indicator 9 – Change in Asset Turnover_**

Asset turnover is defined as total sales scaled by Beginning Year Assets. Sales are extracted from key ratio statement while Beginning Year Assets as computed as per above.  Change in asset turnover is the difference between current year and past year asset turnover.

**Tabulating F-Scores**

As noted under the literature review, instead of adhering to the original score groupings, High F-Score group consists of scores from 7-9 while Low F-Score group consists of score from 1-3.


### 2. Financial Fiscal Date Period

Having selected companies from a list under NASDAQ in 2017/2018, some of these companies would not have been publicly listed for the entire past 10 years since 2008. Therefore, the holding period of these companies would be based on public listed date up till 2017 or its delisted date, whichever earlier. Such information is gathered based on two fronts, from the availability of financial data and trading share price on Morningstar and Yahoo Finance respectively. Only under the circumstance that information is available from both sources for the same period, F-Score can be computed.

**Availability of Financial Information from Morningstar**


Under the assumption that a company is not publicly-listed based if the company does not have any shares/equity, shares is used as an indicator to identify the company’s start and end date. There is no needed to take end date/delisting date into account as using the list of companies extracted from NASDAQ in 2017/2018 already nullify this potential issue. 

**Availability of Trading Share Price from Yahoo Finance**

Based on the extraction of share price from Yahoo Finance, the earliest trading date can be identified by the earliest available share price information.

**Setting holding period by comparing and combining both data sets**

As both data sets (Financial Information and Share Price) are required, the later of the two dates is used as the companies’ starting date for testing.  However, it should be noted that the starting date, if based on trading share price is minus by 1, as the financial information prior to the trading share price date can be used to assess for F-Score.  

### 3. Share Price Returns

For the computation of share price returns, quarterly returns are computed initially as stand alone variables, and subsequently combined as yearly returns, take into account companies' different fiscal year-end period. Returns are computed from the beginning of the fourth month after the firm's fiscal year-end to ensure that the annual financial statement are available by then. Furthermore, the returns on share price based on stock-splits or reverse stock-splits are readjust to ensure that returns are not inflated/deflated during the relevant testing period. 

### 4. Filtering of outliers 

Companies with 0 F-Scores are filtered out due to the low number (22) of such companies,  which may cause violation of the normal distribution assumption for statistical testing. Besides, holding returns above 200% are filtered out as outliers. Companies with daily trading volumes below 10,000 shares are also excluded from testing to take into account the trading liquidity of tested companies. 
	
Additional information is also added such as industry/sector groupings for each company for more detailed testing. 

Research Analysis/Findings
--------------------------
### Hypothesis 1

Empirical results show that F-Score still maintains its effectiveness in identifying companies with superior returns from companies with subpar returns. The results are as follows:-

**Summary Data**

| Grouping   |	Holding Return 	|Standard Deviation	|Sample Size 	|Q25	|Q50	|Q75  |

|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|15.096 |2610.8|2.2e-16|Yes|					

**Findings**

From the T-test performed, there is a signficant difference between High and Low F-Score holding returns at 95% confidence. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. As seen from the summary data, High F-Score have an additional mean returns of 26.8% compared to Low F-Score companies. Besides, High F-Score companies also have lower returns volatilty compared to Low F-Score companies as inferred from the summary data and plots. 

There are more High F-Score companies in the sample as compared to Low F-Score due to the survivorship biases of the company list selected. As explained, this would positively skew the mean return of Low F-Score companies. It should be noted that despite the overstatement of returns of low F-Score companies, there is still a significant difference present between High and Low F-Score companies.

Therefore, companies with High F-Score possess higher returns and lower return volailty, translating to lower investment risk compared to companies with Low F-Score. 

### Hypothesis 2

Empirical results show that the original F-Score grouping can optionally include other F-Score to enchance returns. 

**Summary Data**

|F Score	|Holding_Return	|Std	|No. Samples	|Q25		|Q50		|Q75		|TukeyHD Test Grouping	|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
|1		|0.053		|0.709	|98		|-0.412		|-0.122		|0.314		|cd			
|2		|-0.049		|0.584	|428		|-0.478		|-0.132		|0.251		|d

**Scatter Line Plot**

![Plot](https://github.com/kohtseyoung/F-Score-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Images/Plots/GG_Line_All.png)

**Findings**

As seen from the data above, there is steady increase in mean returns across the F-Score. Additionally, it also should be noted from the summary table that that there is significant changes in returns between the following F-Scores: "1 -> 2", "3 -> 8", "8-9". Focusing on these three significant increase, F-Score 1 higher returns is countered by its high return volality (the highest Standard Deviation).  F-Scores from 3 to 8 shows to have both higher returns and lower return volatility than its previous scores. For "8-9", F-Score 8 despite having higher returns, it also suffered from a slightly higher return volatity compared to F-Score 9. 

From the results of TukeyHD test, the 9 F-Scores returns can be split into 6 groups in total. The significant difference between most scores shows that there can be a high flexiblity and autonomy for the assignment of F-Score into the Low and High groups. 


**Sharpe Ratio Analysis**

|F Score	|Holding_Return	|Risk-Free Rate	|Excess Return	|Sharpe Ratio	|	
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1		|0.053		|0.0283		|0.025		|0.035		|		
|2		|-0.059		|0.0283		|-0.078		|-0.133		|			
|3		|-0.11		|0.0283		|-0.040		|-0.071		|			
|4		|0.050		|0.0283		|0.021		|0.039		|			
|5		|0.113		|0.0283		|0.085		|0.176		|			
|6		|0.184		|0.0283		|0.156		|0.344		|			
|7		|0.235		|0.0283		|0.207		|0.463		|			
|8		|0.275		|0.0283		|0.246		|0.559		|			
|9		|0.255		|0.0283		|0.226		|0.533		|			
* *Risk-Free Rate is based on 10-year US Treasury Bond*

Sharpe Ratio analysis is further performed to determine the trade-off of excess returns per risk (Standard Deviation) for each F-Scores, enabling more informed judgment for the most suitable groupings for both High and Low groups.

Comparing the results from above to the original F-Score groupings, it is reasonable to include F-Score 1-3 as Low F-Score Group due to both low returns and high return volality as seen from the table above (the lowest 3 Sharpe Ratio). On the other hand, F-Score 7-9 as High F-Score is also a reasonable basis due to having the top 3 Sharpe Ratio.

Therefore, although we can reject the null hypothesis as noted from the TukeyHD Test, the original F-Score grouping is still effective in grouping company with high and low returns seperately. However, investors can consider including other F-Scores into both groups, specifically 2-3 into Low F-Score and 7 into High F-Score in order to enchance returns, based on their risk and return trade-off preferences.

### Hypothesis 3

Empirical results show that changing F-Score indicator "Increase in number of shares" from a negative indicator to a positive indicator do not yield significantly higher returns.

**Summary Data**

|F-Score	|High		|Std(High) 	|Low		| Std(Low)	|P-value	|Significant at 95%?|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Original	|0.249		|0.443	 	|-0.0181	|0.577		|2.2E-16	|Yes		|
|Modified	|0.249		|0.443	 	|-0.0248	|0.574		|2.2E-16	|Yes		|		
|Difference	|0		|		|-0.0067	|		|		|		|

From the data shown above, the modified F-Score performs better than the original F-Score in identifying subpar companies. The modified Low F-Score grouping have a slighty lower mean returns and volatility rate.

Based on the findings, the "Change in number of shares"  is ineffective in identifying High F-Score companies. Conversely, it acts as a positive indicator to a certain degree in identifying companies with low performance. It is inconsistent with the Pecking Order Theory regarding it being a negative indicator. 

A possible rationale for its one-sided impact could be investors are less concerned with capital financial structure for companies with healthy financial performance. Besides, company with low performance, coupled with decrease in number of shares, may signal to investors on potential downsizing plans, indicating no growth/profitable opportunities for its current core businesses. 

Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Although the "Change in Number of Shares" may serve as a significant indicator over financially distressed companies as seen the Original F-Score paper, it yields low explanatory power in identifying high and low performing companies when applied accross companies in general.

### Hypothesis 4

Empirical results show that the effectiveness of F-Score varies across different sectors.

**Summary Data**


|Sectors		|No. Samples 	|High F-Score Mean 	|Low F-Score Mean	|Difference	|P-value|Significant at 95?|

As inferred from the data above, F-Score does not serve as an effective investment tool for companies in the following sectors: Public Utilities, Energy and Consumer Non-Durables. This is especially true for companies in th ePublic Utilities sector as the mean returns for its Low F-Score group is higher than the High F-Score group.

As noted under Literature Review, F-Score effectiveness is heavily reliant on the sectors’ financial reporting format. Similarly to companies from the finance sector, companies from the Energy and Public Utilities sector have to adhere to financial reporting standards unique to their sectors. This would dampen the explanatory power of F-Score indicators.

Lastly for Consumer Non-Durables, the high P-value is mainly due to its high Low F-Score mean returns. In particular, companies from the Food Distribution industry presents skewed the returns from Low F-Score companies. However, the specifc reason cannot be accurately identified whether its due to outliers or the nature of such business, based on its low sample size (2 companies).

Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between High F-Score and Low F-Score group’s market adjusted return for majority of Sectors tested, with the exception of Public Utilities, Energy and Consumer Non-Durables sectors.

### Hypothesis 5

Empirical results show that the effectiveness of F-Score varies accross the years.

As shown from the data above, F-Score was not useful in identifying companies with stronger returns and weaker returns consistently across the years. It should be noted that this inconsistency was only noted in Y2009 and Y2017.  F-Score remains effective from Y2014 to Y2017.  

For Y2009, the High F-Score a possible explanation would be due to the 2008 – 2009 World Financial Crisis, obstructing the effectiveness of the F-Score indicator. As previously noted, F-Score is used to identify companies with superior financial performance, which in-turn should reflect stronger holding returns. However, holding returns are not solely affected by companies’ performance. Global economy, regional economy and investors’ confidence also plays a significant role in determining holding returns. Nevertheless, it can be argued that such factors should have an effect on companies from both high and low groups, thus the difference should remain significant. In light of this, economic downturn can be inferred to have a higher impact on higher performing companies.  

For Y2017, despite the significant difference between mean returns from the High and Low F Score group, the high P-value is due to high standard error and volatility, contributed by its low sample size. For future testing, an increase in sample size would assist in reducing the P-Value. 

Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. The effectiveness of F-Score varies across different years, particularly during times of recession. F-Score should not be the sole means for investors to identify profitable companies but a complimentary one. This is because financial performance is not the only factor that determines a company’s holding return.


Conclusion
--------------

F-Score serves as an effective investment analysis tool for identifying share holding returns of companies based on financial performance. The results yields multiple implications in both theoritical and practical asepcts of the F-Score. 

### Theortical aspect

In light of the ability to earn higher returns through F-Score analysis, this proposes that share prices does not timely incorporate and reflect all readily financial information. Therefore, the weak market hypothesis holds true not only for finanlly distressed companies but also frequent publicly traded companies. 

Conversely,  the F-Score indicator "Change in number of shares" being slightly positively correlated with holding returns for low F-Score companies is in violation of the Pecking Order Theory. Investors place a heavier emphasis on capital structure changes for company experiencing low financial performance. This shows that this indicator does not functions as an effective gauge for companies in general. A suggestion for further research may include applying different weightage on each indicator to distinguish and maximise F-Score's explanatory power for non-financial distressed companies.   

### Practical aspect

Regarding the application of F-Score, modification can be made to further enhance the returns such as by extending the F-Score groupings or focus specifically on certain industries. Nevertheless, relying solely on financial performance to predict holding returns is not as effective as returns are affected by both company and economic specific factors.  Although it can be argued that economic specific factors are already reflected in the companies’ performance, it also plays a big role in influencing investors’ confidence and trading tendencies. 

For practical investment application, investors can utilize F-Score to partake in multiple investment strategies to attain their preferred risk exposure (Company, Sector and Market). Longing high F-Score companies will give investors exposure to both companies and market risks. Buying the indices will give investors exposure to market risks, while eliminating company specific risk. Longing high F-Score and shorting low F-Score on the other hand, will provide company risks exposure and partially eliminate market risks. The reason being, based on the findings above, market risk has a higher impact on high F-Score companies compared to low F-Score companies. Therefore, the market risks cannot be equally offset from the long-short investment strategy. Investors can also further expose themselves to sector risk by applying the above three strategies in selected preferred sectors. Nevertheless, it should be noted that F-Score is only solely capable of assessing company's risk. Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate other forms of analysis, especially when the selected investment strategies include different forms of risks.
