Cornerstone Project Proposal
==============================

1)Piotroski F-Score
-----------------
### What does it do?

It uses financial indicators to assess health and performance of a company using binary factor throughout 9 indicators (Split into 3 groups). The higher the score, the better the company’s prospective.
What can be done?
•	Check which group/indicators play a more significant role in deducing better company’s performance (can go one step further by splitting by company’s characteristics or industry)
•	Add additional variables into the model to increase accuracy (eg. FS-model which includes operational changes/improvements or M-score which assess risk as presented below)
•	Assess stickiness of indicators using lagged indicators to assess the company’s future performance or the variance of the individual indicators across the years

### Data Set

Companies on major indices such as S&P,NASDAQ and Dow Jones are easy to acquire. However, while acquiring company’s financial information in terms of breath is not an issue, depth is limited as most financial information websites provides up to 5 years of historical data.


2)Fundamental Analysis Models in Financial Markets
-----------------

### What does it do?

By using standard financial indicators such as P/E, dividend discount model etc, it tries to evaluate the company on whether it is currently overvalued or undervalued. While F-score assumes that financial indicators translate to financial strength and its end-game, superior performance, fundamental valuation model aims to find out whether a company’s stock is a good or bad move. There are DDM/CAPM, Earning Multiples, Discounted Cash Flow Model, Residual Income Valuation Model.
What can be done?
•	Compare which valuation model is more accurate or which combinations of models are better together.
•	Use on different data sets: Developed and Emerging markets
•	Can be combined with F-score as well

### Data Set

Data sets required are more comprehensive than above as it also requires company’s closing stock prices. Acquiring or even computing company’s beta, a major variable which assess company’s risk is difficult, computationally intensive and prone to errors.
