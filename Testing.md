Introduction
------------
This study seeks to examine the usefulness of Joseph D. Piotroski’s F-Score which uses historical financial statement information to identify companies with superior performance as well as deploy it as a foundational base where other inputs can be modified to further improve on the original’s effectiveness.

Literature Review
-----------------
The F-score is a widely known performance/investment strategy due to its simplicity and accessibility. It uses public published information readily available for investor to separate strong performers from weak performers among high book-to-market firms. A score is computed based on 9 criteria categorized into 3 different groups and are summarized as follows:



|	|Profitability|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|Return on Assets	1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise|
|2|	Operating Cash Flow	1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise|
|3|	Change in Return of Assets (ROA)	1 point if ROA is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)|
|4|Accruals	1 point if Operating Cash Flow/Total Assets is higher than ROA in the current year, 0 otherwise|

| |Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds|
|:---:|:---:|
|5|	Change in Leverage (long-term) ratio	1 point if the ratio is lower this year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise|
|6|	Change in Current ratio	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise
|7|	Change in the number of shares	1 point if no new shares were issued during the last year

| |Operating Efficiency|
|:---:|:---:|
|8|	Change in Gross Margin	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise
|9	|Change in Asset Turnover ratio	1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise

**Relevancy of F-Score in Today’s Economy**

The empirical study of the F-Score is based on companies selected from 1976 and 1996. Since then, in the past 20 years, the overall economy landscape has experience massive seismic shifts; from multiple recessions (Dot.com bubble burst from 1997-2001, The Great Recession from 2007-2012) to the explosive growth of tech-based companies and slow-decline of manufacturing firms. Besides, there have been monumental changes to organization structure of companies, many opting for a more flat-based structure rather than a hierarchical one to cope with the ever-changing economy. This has in turn impact on how companies’ resources and finance are managed. 

While the aforementioned events may undermine the credibility of the F-Score, amongst the many changes, stronger financial regulations and corporate governance have been consistently implemented across the decades, aiming for higher financial reporting transparency and accountability. These developments have strengthened F-Score’s core idea of utilizing historical financial performance data to predict strong performers.  To name one, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also known the “Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act in response to the financial scandal revolving Enron mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures from  corporations from possibly fraudulent activities. With better financial reporting, financial data provided from companies can be used more reliably for analytic purposes.

In conclusion, while recent economy changes may downplay F-Score’s usefulness, the stringent financial disclosures required from companies serves as an overarching foundation for F-Score due to its heavy reliance on such data. These circumstances serve as a strong motivation to reassess the credibility of the F-Score and modify the indicators accordingly if needed to suit the stance of today’s economy.
